# FlipBun - The Flipping Card Game
- This is a website created by me inspired by that typical childhood game we played atleast once i our life time, the card memory game.
- I decided to make this game as i recently learned how to make games. Well i am still learning so i do not know all of it but this was the first game my borther taught me to make. 
- I did try to make it a little different in level 3 with my old logic.

# Problems
- In how.html the svg seems to be stuck above. I do not know why its visible like that. Is it my code which is causing problem?
- The code indentation seems to be messy and i did write it properly, something wrong in VS Code.
